            <p>Documentation such as police
                reports or medical records is required, and in cases of rape, incest, or human trafficking,
                the
                physician must report
                the situation appropriately.

                Only a physician can perform or induce an abortion; telehealth or remote methods are not
                allowed for
                this procedure.
                Consent must be obtained voluntarily and informed, with the physician providing detailed
                information and
                a mandatory
                24-hour waiting period. In emergencies where the consent requirements cannot be met, a
                physician may
                proceed with
                documentation of medical necessity. The procedure must follow high standards of care,

            <h2 id="myth">The Myth of "Post-Birth" Abortions</h2>
            <p>
                Killing an infant after birth is infanticide and is illegal in all 50 states. Situations resulting in a
                fetal death in
                the third trimester are exceedingly rare, and involve emergencies such as fetal anomalies or
                life-threatening medical
                emergencies affecting the mother.

            <h2 id="anomalies">Fetal Anomalies</h2>
            <p>
                "About 120,000 pregnancies in the United States each year are affected by fetal anomalies, which are
                genetic or physical
                defects of varying severity that can impact pregnancy, delivery and the child’s health, according to the
                Centers for
                Disease Control and Prevention." Meanwhile, a quarter of pregnant people don't start receiving prenatal
                care until after 12 weeks. This means many fetal anomalies will not be detected until it is illegal to
                get an abortion.
                Forced pregnancy for a dying fetus is immoral. Abortion bans require a woman to carry fetal
                anomalies to birth, or until the woman's
                life is in imminent danger.

            <h2 id="later">Abortions later in pregnancy</h2>
            <p>"Abortions at or after 21 weeks are uncommon and represent less than 1% of all abortions in the U.S. The
                procedures
                are expensive
                and often require travel and lost wages. They normally require treatment over multiple days and are only
                performed by a
                subset of all abortion providers." Healthcare providers are bound by strict ethical boundaries and will
                only perform these abortions if necessary.
                Abortions at this time fall into the following categories:
            <ol>
                <li>Late detection of fetal anomaly. Either the fetus will be a stillborn, or would survive for only a
                    short time</li>
                <li>Increasing incidence of maternal health complications with advanced gestation</li>
                <li>Barriers to obtaining an abortion earlier (financial, abortion laws, finding medical facilities,
                    unknown pregnancy)</li>

                and Reform Judaism, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the Unitarian Universalist Church and the United
                Church of Christ. Relgion can play a role in a woman's journey through pregnancy. However, this is a
                choice
                that must
                be held between the person carrying a fetus, their doctor, and God.

                before birth. At 6 weeks gestation, the cells developing in the uterus are called

                <strong>Maternal Mortality:</strong>
                The maternal mortality rate for 2021 was 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births. To carry a pregnancy to
                term is a risk that not everyone is willing to take.
                <br><strong>Postpartum Physical Health:</strong>
                After pregnancy, the health-issues are not over. It will take up to 6 weeks to recover from Postpartum
                bleeding, vaginal pain, incontinence and cramping.

                <br><strong>Mental Health:</strong>
                The health risks are not only physical; many people experience changes in mental health during
                pregnancy. "Up to 20% of women suffer from mood or anxiety disorders during pregnancy."
                <br><strong>Postpartum Mental Health:</strong>
                Furthermore, during the postpartum period, "85% of women experience some type of mood disturbance. For
                most the
                symptoms are
                mild and short-lived; however, 10 to 15% of women develop more significant symptoms of depression or
                anxiety."

                a total of $18,865 and
                the average out-of-pocket payments total $2,854." Additionally, during pregnancy women experience pain,
                discomfort, severe fatigue,
                depression, and limited physical capabilities. These symptoms are a challenge to maintaining
                pre-pregnancy working hours and income.</p>
